Introduction 

Thank you for purchasing the 7K Digital Audio Board (DAB). 

The DAB has been designed as a “drop-in” replacement for the Speech Synthesizer board in the S-Com 7K repeater 
controller, but does more than just talk. 

The DAB utilizes a fast, FLASH based, single chip microprocessor to support audio playback from a FLASH based Multi-
Media Card (MMC) which is used to store digitized speech files played back in response to commands from the 7K 
repeater controller. 

The MMC media card is the same type of solid state storage media that is used in many consumer devices such as 
cameras, personal digital assistants, and MP3 players. The file system used on the FLASH card is the same FAT16 file 
system used on desktop computers for years and is thus compatible with any third party MMC I/O device that supports 
this type of file system. The FAT16 file system constrains the total storage space to approximately 2 Gigabytes, which 
provides the potential to store hours of audio material. The user is free to upgrade the amount of storage space available 
at any time simply by purchasing higher capacity FLASH cards from the vendor of their choice. 

The audio files are stored in the well-known WAV file format, which is a subset of the Microsoft Resource Interchange File 
Format (RIFF) file format. This flexible file format supports dozens of different audio compression methods, of which the 
DAB supports only a few specific types. 

The DAB also has an RS-232 serial port that can be used to send or retrieve files from the FLASH card in order to allow 
the update of audio files, product firmware, and to make product configuration changes. 

The DAB’s product firmware is fully field updateable and new firmware revisions can be installed by the end as they 
become available. 

If you have any questions or comments regarding this product, please know that your feedback is always appreciated.

Installation 

CAUTION: 
The DAB is a static sensitive electronic device. Proper precautions should be exercised when handling the DAB. 
Installation and connection of the DAB can only be performed with power removed from the controller. 

Installation into the rack mount cabinet. 

The DAB is installed in the controller cabinet to the left of the repeater controller circuit board and secured in place with 
four 6-32 screws. 


Using the supplied ribbon cable, connect the ribbon cable 
between J4 on the DAB and the speech board connection, 
P8, on the 7K repeater controller PCB. 

As the 7K does not use a keyed or shrouded connector, use 
due caution when making the connection to the 7K 
connector. If the cable is not inserted correctly, severe 
damage may occur to the DAB and will not be covered 
by warranty. 


If the serial port on the DAB will be utilized, the short ribbon cable assembly containing the DB-9 connector can be 
connected to J3 on the DAB. The method of routing the cable out of the 7K cabinet and/or mounting of the DB-9 
connector in the cabinet is left to the end user. Please note that the modification of the controller cabinet may void your 
warranty with S-Com. 

If you do attempt to modify the cabinet, please use proper precautions to guard against physical damage to the circuit 
boards inside the cabinet, and against any metal debris which could potentially short components on the PCB’s.

Installing the FLASH Card 

The multi-media FLASH card should be inserted into the connector as shown, with the gold contacts facing downward. 
When the card is not installed in the DAB, do not touch the gold contacts. 


7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


Updating the 7K repeater controller firmware 

An EPROM containing new firmware for the 7K has also been included with the DAB. This new firmware provides better 
integration between the DAB and 7K controller as well as providing new, generic, features to the 7K itself. 

When version 2.04 firmware is installed in the 7K, the 7K will need to be re-initialized before it will work, and the 
user will need to reload their program into the controller. 

The DAB will work with any version of S-Com firmware that supported the speech synthesizer module, and you may elect 
to defer the installation of the new controller firmware. 

If your controller is not already at a 2.x version status, and you wish to utilize the new firmware, you will need to contact S-
Com regarding upgrading other components on the 7K controller board. 

To change the Firmware, use an IC extraction tool to exert equal force on each end of the old EPROM while pulling 
straight up. Place the old EPROM in conductive foam, and then install the new EPROM as shown in the picture below. 
Pin one, on the notched end of the EPROM, should be facing towards the rear of the cabinet.

Using the DAB 

LED Status indicator 

The DAB has a dual color surface mount LED mounted near the board edge near the FLASH card connector. 

If the FLASH card is present upon power up, the dual color LED on the DAB should briefly illuminate green as the FAT file 
system code initializes its internal variables. 
If the FLASH card is removed, both LED’s will illuminate and provide a yellowish glow to indicate the absence of the card. 
When the FLASH card is present, if the LED glows solid Red, with brief flashes of Green, this indicates that the FLASH 

media is not correctly formatted. 
In normal operation, the Green LED will flicker when the FLASH card is being accessed for reading, and the Red LED will 
flicker when the FLASH card is being accessed for writing. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


Basic use 

In its simplest form, the DAB will mimic the original S-Com speech synthesizer board, and thus it is compatible with any 

version of 7K firmware that supported the speech board. 
The default speech library included with the DAB includes digitized versions of the original TI speech synthesizer 
vocabulary. The recordings of the TI speech synthesizer have been low pass filtered to provide a sound which is less 
harsh than the original speech synthesizer. 

In addition to the original vocabulary, additional words have been recorded by a professional voice over talent. The list of 
those words can be found in Appendix A. 
If the user wishes to have custom words and phrases recorded in the same voice they may contact: 
Sean Caldwell, KF4IWT 
Phone: 212.898.1222 

http://www.seancaldwell.com/ 

Sean has agreed to contract with the end users of this product for a very reasonable price.

Supported WAV File formats 

For those that wish to create their own WAV files, you will need to know about some specific constraints of exactly what 
the DAB does and does not support. 

PCM. 8 or 16 bit linear (uncompressed) values, in either mono or stereo format. The maximum supported sample rate is 
22.05kHz. 

muLaw. This is a logarithmically compressed format which stores 8 bits per sample and expands to approximately 12 bits 
of precision. Mono and Stereo forms are supported. The maximum supported sample rate is 22.05kHz. 

IMA/DVI ADPCM. Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation essentially stores the difference from one sample to the next. 
Several different ADPCM methods and subsets are part of the WAV file specification, the one that the DAB supports is 
specifically this type, with 4 bits per sample, in mono format only. The maximum supported sample rate is 16kHz. 

For the types that support stereo file playback, no attempt is made to “mix” the two channels together and the data stream 
for only the left channel will be audible. 

If a WAV file is stored using an unsupported compression method, or at too high of a sample rate, the DAB will simply 
treat the file as a missing file and refuse to play it. 

Things to consider when deciding file storage parameters 

If the user wishes to provide for the highest fidelity playback, then the files should be stored as 16 bit PCM files. Using 
this storage method consumes two bytes of disk space per sample. 

If the user wishes to conserve as much disk space as possible, then the ADPCM compression method is recommended. 
Using this storage method, two samples are stored in one byte of disk space. 

The default speech libraries included with the DAB utilize muLaw compression for the TI speech synthesizer recordings, 
and ADPCM for the live recordings. Both types are sampled at 11.025kHz. 

It was found that applying ADPCM compression to the TI synthesizer recordings resulted in objectionable artifacts when 
the files were played, but these same artifacts were not nearly as noticeable for the live recordings. 

The practical limit of a narrowband FM voice channel is about 48dB Signal to Noise ratio, so what may sound 
objectionable in your recording studio, may be inaudible to the end user. 

Sample rates higher than 11.025kHz will be of little practical use when the high frequency rolloff of a normal two-
way radio is considered. In fact, the end user may find that recordings at 8kHz sample rates are quite 
satisfactory. 

When making your own live recordings using “built-in” audio hardware in your budget desktop computer, you may find that 
recording at these lower sample rates results in muddy sounding audio, and come to the conclusion that even a 22.05kHz 
sample rate just isn’t enough. In this case, the real culprit is the poor performance of the low cost audio card in your 
computer. Here you have two potential solutions. Either record at a higher sample rate, such as 44.1kHz and then 
downsample to a lower rate, or buy yourself a professional grade audio card that doesn’t have these same performance 
limitations.

Recommended editing programs 

Adobe Audition, formally Syntrillium Software’s Cool Edit Pro product, is a preferred tool we use here. 

http://www.adobe.com/ 

SoX – Sound eXchange is a useful tool that claims to be the “swiss army knife of sound processing programs”. This 
useful utility can convert from just about any sound format to another format, change sample rates, pitch, speed, filter, etc. 

http://sox.sourceforge.net/ 

Goldwave – is a low cost, simple digital audio editor. 

http://www.goldwave.com/ 

Sound Forge – is a higher end digital audio editor, with capabilities similar to Adobe’s Audition product. 

http://www.sonicfoundry.com/ 

There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of software utilities available to edit, and manipulate WAV files, and to cover 
them all in this manual would be impossible. The short list above represents those we have direct experience with and 
wouldn’t hesitate to recommend. 

Storing files on the FLASH card 

Multi-Media Card adapters 

A wide range of options exist in both internal and external FLASH card adapters that are compatible with modern desktop 
computers. One of the most common adapters plugs into the USB port on your computer and allows you to read and 
write files to one or more FLASH card media types. 

These types of media adapters can generally be purchased new for less than $20 at your local computer store. 

Due to the variety of products available, it is beyond the scope of this manual to provide a tutorial on their use. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


File system requirements 

The Multi-Media Card needs to be formatted with a DOS FAT16 file format. For smaller media types, the default of the 
format program you utilize may format the card with a FAT12 file system, and you will need to override the default 
settings. 

Example: 

To format a 16MB card under Windows 2000, open a Command Prompt Window and type: 

FORMAT d: /a:1024 

Where ‘d’ equals the drive letter corresponding to the MMC card, and 1024 equals the size, in bytes, of each cluster. 
You will be prompted: 

Insert new disk for drive d: 
and press ENTER when ready... 

Hit [Enter] to continue. 

The type of the file system is FAT. 
Verifying 15M 
Initializing the File Allocation Table (FAT)... 
Volume label (11 characters, ENTER for none)? 

Hit [Enter] to continue. 
Format complete. 
15,960,064 bytes total disk space. 
15,960,064 bytes available on disk. 
1,024 bytes in each allocation unit. 
15,586 allocation units available on disk. 
16 bits in each FAT entry. 
Volume Serial Number is 10D5-D722 

The key thing here is to select a cluster size for the disk that results in the format program showing a summary of “16 bits 
in each FAT entry.”. 

The most efficient disk utilization will generally be realized when the smallest possible cluster size is selected, however 
other factors, such as the increase in the FAT table size may offset any gains that may occur through any increase in disk 
utilization efficiency.

File system structure for the Audio Files 

The WAV files need to be stored in a predetermined manner in order on the FLASH card. 

The Root directory needs to contain a “WAV” subdirectory, and the WAV subdirectory needs to contain additional four 
digit numeric subdirectories corresponding to the “hundreds” portion of the word number to be spoken. Within each of 
those subdirectories, up to 100 WAV files can be stored. 

The file naming convention for each WAV file simply correlates one-for-one with the word number issued from the 7K 
command 15. 

For example if you wanted to associate a given WAV file with word 3024 you would name the file “3024.WAV” and store it 
in the “\WAV\3000\” subdirectory. Similarly word 0007 would be named as “0007.WAV” and stored in the “\WAV\0000\” 
subdirectory. 

With the exception of the reserved word “0000” and words greater than “9699”, you may utilize as many of the word 
numbers as you like, up to the limits of the storage space on your FLASH card. 

Special files stored in the root directory 

CONFIG.INI 

This text file contains user settings that need to survive a power failure. It is a simple text file that contains a variable 
keyword, equals sign, and desired setting for the associated parameter. 

Comment lines can be preceded with a semicolon, or simply contain white space. 

The supported keywords are: 

· BaudRate. Specify any standard baudrate up through 115200 baud. If not specified, the default baudrate of 115200 
baud will be used. 
· Password. This is the case sensitive password used to protect access to the serial port. Only the first 8 characters 
are used, and if not specified, the serial port will not require a password. 

· BusyMsg. Specify a Morse code message to be played when the 7K commands the 7KDAB to play a file during 
periods when the file system is busy. Only the first 9 characters are used. If not specified, the default message of 
“BZ” will be used. 

Example file contents: 

; Configuration file for 7K-DAB 
BaudRate = 38400 
Password = Secret 
BusyMsg = WR9ACY/R 

DAB-MAIN.BIN 

This file contains the microcontroller’s firmware. If this file exists, its contents are checked against the current program 
stored in the microcontrollers own FLASH memory. If they are different, the microcontroller will reprogram itself and 
reboot to begin execution of the new firmware. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


DAB-BOOT.BIN 

This file contains the small bootstrap loader used to reprogram the microcontroller. If this file exists, its contents are 
checked against its program storage space in FLASH memory. If they are different, the microcontroller will reprogram this 
portion of the FLASH memory. 

7K-IMAGE.BIN 

This file contains an image of the 7K controller’s battery backed SRAM. Special commands can be used to save or 
restore the contents of the controllers programming. 

7K-PATCH.BIN 

This file contains a program image of the 7K firmware patch area. 

Special Words 

Words 9700 through 9799 have been reserved for use by the DAB. When these special words are “spoken” they trigger 
special things to occur. Some of the functions represent a stand-alone function performed by the DAB and others 
represent a cooperative effort between the new firmware on the 7K and the DAB. 

9700 – Custom Delay 

When this word is spoken, the word that follows it is used as a delay factor with its time specified in milliseconds. 

For example, “9700 1000” would cause a 1 second silent pause during playback. 

The maximum delay that can be specified is 5000ms. 

9701 – Long word continuation 

With 7K firmware revisions prior to 2.04, there is a hard coded timeout timer in the 7K firmware designed to detect a failed 
speech board. While the 7K documentation documents this timeout timer as being 5 seconds, in reality a software bug 
caused it to be 25 seconds. 

In order to allow a DAB user to playback a speech file longer than 25 seconds, the DAB has a timer which artificially 
signals the 7K that a phrase has been completely spoken even though playback continues. If the next word received is 
9701, the DAB will continue to play the file already in progress, and approximately 25 seconds later signal the 7K that the 
phrase has been completely spoken. 

For example, “{PW} 15 9960 5000 9701 9701 9701” would allow 5000.WAV to play for approximately 100 seconds if 
needed. 

There is no harm in issuing too many 9701 continuation words. If no playback is in process, the DAB will simply 
handshake with the 7K and move on to the next word. 

This command is not needed with version 2.04 firmware as the keep-alive handshake will occur automatically in 
the background.

9702 – Playback Speed Factor 

When this word is spoken, the word that follows it is used as a playback speed multiplier against the playback rate 
specified in the WAV file header. The word value supplied is specified as a percentage of the playback speed with 0100 
(100%) being the normal playback rate. 

The value specified can range from 1 to 255%, but if the resulting playback rate exceeds the sample rate limits for the 
WAV file, the playback rate will be limited to appropriate maximum playback rate. 

The playback speed factor is a static value which defaults to 100% on reset. Whenever a user supplied value is specified, 
that playback speed factor remains as the new playback rate until either a new factor is specified, or until a reset occurs. 

For example, “{PW}15 9960 9702 0120” would set the playback rate to 120% of normal speed. 

9710 – Play Random File 

When this control word is issued, the next two word values are used as a starting and ending word value for the controller 
to psuedo-randomly play an audio file within the inclusive range supplied. There is no restriction on the start or end value 
other than that they need to be in the range of 0001 through 9699. 

Due to the integer math used, and the fact that any pseudo-random number generator has its limitations, the user will find 
that the span will affect the apparent randomness of the file chosen. Spans that represent a power of two will appear to 
give the best degree of randomness, but the span may be of any desired size and should still to be sufficiently random for 
the purposes of this function. 

Some examples: 

{PW} 15 9960 9710 3000 3010 ;play one audio file from the range of 3000 – 3010 
{PW} 15 9960 9710 1000 4000 ;play one audio file from the range of 1000 -4000 
{PW} 15 9960 9710 4021 4022 ;play either audio file 4021 or 4022 

Note: This will also select and play CW files included within the selection range, so it is conceivable to mix audio 
tracks with CW messages if desired.

9720 – Send Serial Characters 

In order to allow a modem to share the same phone line that the repeater controller is connected to, one or more macros 
will need to be created in the 7K to cause the modem to answer, or place a call on its own. 

Once special word 9720 is encountered, the decimal of each word encountered after it will be used to determine which 
ASCII character to send on the serial port. Any word value greater than 0256 will exit the ASCII character mode. 

A null character can be sent by using a word value of 0256. 

A chart of ASCII characters is provided in Appendix B. 

In the following example, two macro’s are created to allow the 7K to answer the phone line. The first macro causes the 
modem to generate answer tones, and then, after pausing, executes a second macro to cause the 7K to hang up the 
phone line. The delay in this process ensures that the phone call is not dropped in the process of handing off the call to 
the modem. 

; Macro 5782 sends “ATA<CR>” to modem, delays for 2 seconds, then triggers macro 5783 
{PW} 20 5782 {PW} 15 9960 9720 0065 0084 0065 0013 0500 9700 2000 9999 5783 

; Macro 5783 disconnects Autopatch line. 
{PW} 20 5783 {PW} 83 

If you wanted the repeater to call you back on a separate modem line you could configure macro’s as follows. 

;Macro 5784 disconnects the autopatch line, pauses for two seconds then sends “ATDT5551212<CR>”. 
{PW} 20 5784 {PW} 83 
{PW} 29 5784 {PW} 15 9960 9700 2000 9720 0065 0084 0068 0084 0053 0053 0053 0049 0050 0049 0050 0013 0500 

Obviously you will need to replace 555-1212 with the phone number you desire the modem to call. 

9790 – Force 7KDAB Reset 

In the event that the 7KDAB firmware should get “stuck”, it may be possible to issue this word to force the 7KDAB to reset. 

Although the 7KDAB does contain a hardware watchdog that will reset the CPU in the event that the 7KDAB should stop 
executing as desired, there may be unforeseen situations where the software may appear to operate properly yet fail to 
respond to the serial port. Because the 7K host interface software operates at an interrupt level, it may be possible for the 
7KDAB to respond to this command. 

Example: 

{PW} 15 9960 9790 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


Notice: 

The following special word commands were included to aid in the overall firmware development process and are 
somewhat experimental. While they are implemented, they are not supported at this time, but are documented 
here for the sake of completeness. 

Whenever any of these special word commands are issued, 100% of the 7K’s CPU time is dedicated to executing 
the associated command. As such, all other controller activity is frozen… meaning any transmitters currently on 
the air, will stay on the air, no DTMF commands will be possible, etc. 

Issuing these commands with mismatched versions of firmware, may cause either the DAB or the 7K controller 
to hang indefinitely. 

Full support may be available in a future release. 

9796 – Load 7K Patch file 

This causes a patch file to be loaded into the 7K’s firmware patch area. The user needs to be certain that the patch file 
exists before issuing this command, or the firmware load will fail ungracefully by resetting the controller. 

9797 – Provide RTC data to DAB 

This will cause the real time clock maintained in the 7KDAB to be set to the current time in the 7K. 

9798 – Load 7K-IMAGE.BIN 

Issuing this word causes the contents of the 7K’s battery backed SRAM to be overwritten with the contents in this file. 
The image upload takes approximately 25 seconds, after which the 7K will reset. 

Note that this literally will restore the controller to the state that it was in when the save command was executed. Beware 
of what you ask for… for surely you will find it. 

9799 – Save 7K-IMAGE.BIN 

Issuing this word cause the contents of the 7K’s battery backed SRAM to be written to the FLASH card. The image 
download takes approximately 5 seconds.

Morse Code Features 

Message File Location 

Text files containing the desired message along with special control sequences to control pitch, speed, and amplitude can 
be stored in the same directory structure along with the audio files. 

As with the audio files, the Morse code filenames begin with the four digit numeric value of the desired phrase number, 
but in this case use the file extension “CW”. 

When the 7K controller commands the 7KDAB to play a given word, the 7KDAB will first check to see if a ‘xxxx.WAV’ file 
exists, and if none is found, then it will check to see if a ‘xxxx.CW’ file exists, and if present will begin playback of the 
Morse message file. 

Message File contents 

The text file should contain regular ASCII text characters. In addition to letters and numbers, standard punctuation 
characters are supported. The full list of characters is included in Appendix C. 

Any unsupported characters will be translated to a inter-word delay, or “space” character. 

With version 2.04 firmware installed in the 7K controller, the only limitation to the length of a file is the size of the FLASH 
memory card. 

As with speech messages, a Morse message playback may be stopped with the {PW} 16 command (available in 2.04 7K 
firmware), or by issuing the “STOP” command at the serial console prompt. 

Message file control characters 

Unless otherwise specified, the default for a CW message playback is a pitch of 720Hz at 20WPM and one-half maximum 
amplitude. These values are reset at the beginning of each new message playback. 

Special control character sequences are used to set the pitch, speed, and amplitude of the message and can appear 
anywhere within a message. The control sequences consist of a single control character followed by numeric digits and 
terminate with the first non-numeric character. 

Note: If the first desired character after a command sequence is a numeric value the command sequence can be 
terminated with a forward slash ( / ) character, which in that specific circumstance will not be treated as a inter-
character delay. 

Pitch 

A character sequence beginning with a tilde ( ~ ) character denotes a change pitch command. The pitch is specified in 
Hertz, and can range from 1Hz to 5000Hz inclusive. 

Note: The internal frequency resolution is limited to about 600mHz so the specified frequency will vary slightly 
from the specified value. Also note that precision of the frequency is limited to that of the microprocessor grade 
crystal. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


Speed 

Two different control characters are supported for setting the speed. For normal cadences, the percent sign ( % ) is used 
to select a speed ranging from 1 to 50 words-per-minute. 

For code practice purposes, the inter-character speed may be supplied separately by using the asterisk ( * ) character to 
select a speed ranging from 1 to 50 words-per-minute. 

Note: When the ‘%’ character is used, it will set timing values for both the inter and intra character timing values, 
so when using the ‘*’ control character, the ‘%’ control setting should precede the ‘*’ control setting. 

Amplitude 

A character sequence beginning with a up-caret ( ^ ) character denotes a change in amplitude command. The amplitude 
is an 8 bit linear value and can range from 0 (off) to 255 (maximum). 
Sending ‘Prosigns’ 
To send a prosign such as AR, AS, BT, SK, etc., any number of characters can be enclosed in brackets. The left bracket 

( [ )has the effect of reducing the inter-character delay time to one dit time, and the right bracket ( ] ) has the effect of 
restoring the inter-character delay time to three dit times. 

Examples: 
The following message sets the pitch to 880Hz, the amplitude to 128 (or half volume), 20WPM for the character timing, 
and 13WPM for the inter-character timing, then sends “This is a Morse code message”. 

~880^128%20*13This is a Morse code message 

The following example sends “DE KA9FUR” using a different pitch for each character. Note that the command prior to 
sending the ‘9’ is terminated using a backslash. 

^255%13~1000D~1100E~1200 K~1300A~1400\9~1500F~1600U~1700R 

The following example shows how to send a message containing a prosign. 

Wx here is sunny [SK] 
Send 8 dits like this [HH] or this [IIII] or this [EEEEEEEE]

7KDAB ‘Busy’ message 

If the 7K attempts to command the 7KDAB to play a file while the 7KDAB is otherwise preoccupied with another action 
which requires the use of the FLASH file system (such as the user uploading new files to the card), after waiting for 2 
seconds, the 7KDAB will play a short CW message in place of the desired word. 

By default, the message is simply “BZ”, but can be changed by specifying a message of up to 9 characters. This 
message is specified in the “CONFIG.INI” file with the keyword ‘BusyMsg’, which is read when the FLASH file system is 
initialized. 

For situations where the user may have multiple words playing in succession to form a message, the 7KDAB will only play 
the busy message once during a 30 second time window. 

The intent of this feature is to allow a legal identification to occur during periods of time when file system maintenance is 
occurring. While the preferred method of handling this situation would be to create a macro that changes any system 
messages from speech to Morse code, this provides an alternate means of handling this situation. 

Example CONFIG.INI File contents: 

BusyMsg = KA9FUR/R 
Password = Secret 
Baudrate = 115200

Using the Serial Port 

Hardware Interface 

Connecting the DB-9 serial port connector to a PC type computer can be accomplished with a straight through cable. 

The DB-9 connector pinout is as follows: 

1. No Connection 
2. Transmit Data from DAB 
3. Received Data to DAB 
4. Ready to send from PC 
5. Ground 
6. DTR from DAB 
7. Connected to pin 8 
8. Connected to pin 7 
9. No Connection 
When the DAB sees pin 4 go ready, it will start a new command line session. If a password has been set, the DAB will 
prompt the user for a password. When used with a modem, this pin should be tied to the modem’s carrier detect signal. 

Pin 6 will normally be true, but at the end of a session timeout, or as the result of too many incorrect password attempts, 
this line will go false for two seconds and then return true. This can be used, with proper modem configuration, to 
disconnect a dialup caller. 

Modem Wiring: 

DAB (DB9) Modem (DB25) 

22 
33 
48 
57 
6 20 

Baudrate 

The serial port’s baud rate is determined by a setting in the CONFIG.INI file. Any baud rate up to 115200 can be specified 
in the configuration file. 

Password 

The session password, if set in the CONFIG.INI file, must be entered correctly before access is given to the DAB’s 
command line interface. Please note that this password is case sensitive. 

Up to three attempts at entering the correct password are allowed before the DAB drops the DTR signal to disconnect the 
caller.

Connecting a Modem to the Serial Port 

Since every modem tends to be a bit different, it is not possible to provide a single example that will work for everyone, 
but we can point out the important steps that need to be taken. 

First, the modem itself needs to be configured as follows: 

· Fixed DTE Speed. Possible command “AT&B1” 

· Normal Carrier Detect (CD) operation. In other words, CD should indicate whether or not a carrier is present. 

Possible command “AT&C1” 

· Normal DTR operation. Modem should disconnect a caller if DTR goes false. Possible command “AT&D2” 

· No Hardware Flow Control. Possible command “AT&H0” 

· Modem should ignore RTS. Possible command “AT&R1”. Alternately, adding a jumper between pins 4 and 5 

on the modem’s DB25 connector may provide the same results. 

· Modem should not send result codes. Possible command “ATQ1” 

· Modem should not echo characters. Possible command “ATE0” 

Most modern modems should allow you to save these settings to EEPROM. Possible command is “AT&W” 

Some modems have dip switches that allow the same sort of power on settings to be accomplished, yet others may 
require a combination of dip switch and EEPROM settings to be configured. 

The modem can share the telephone line with the repeater controller by creating a couple of simple macro’s. Examples of 
how to do this were provided a few pages ago under the description of how special word 9720 can be used to send 
characters to the serial port. 

Modem wiring may also vary slightly, but in general you will need to connect the four signal wires, plus ground as shown 
on the previous page. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


The Command Line Interface 

Using the Command Line interface (CLI) the user can effect the management of files on the FLASH card. Upon gaining 
access to the DAB’s command line interface the user is presented with the prompt: 

7kDAB-> 

As a preface to the list of the following commands, it is important to note that the file system software in the DAB is single 
threaded. This means that while a WAV file is being played, file system management commands are temporarily locked 
out. 

Similarly, if file management commands are in use, any attempts by the 7K to play a WAV file will fail. In this 
circumstance, the DAB would simply handshake with the 7K as though the file had been played. 

If the user needs to remotely update files on the DAB during periods of repeater use where speech would be regularly 
needed, it is suggested that a user macro be written to temporarily change the repeater’s behavior so that speech is not a 
normal part of the repeater’s operation. 

CD – Change Directory 
While similar to the change directory command under MS-DOS, this command only accepts a fully qualified path name. 
When the present working directory is changed, it is reflected in the CLI prompt. 
Right: 

7kDAB-\>cd \wav\1000 
7kDAB-\WAV\1000> 

7kDAB-\WAV\4300>cd \wav\1000 
7kDAB-\WAV\1000> 

Wrong: 

7kDAB-\WAV\4300>cd ..\1000 
Directory not found 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


DIR – Directory command 
While similar to the directory command under MS-DOS, this command does not accept any parameters. It simply lists all 
the files within the present working directory. 
Example: 

7kDAB-\>dir 
MMC Card MID: 6, PNM: KODAK , PSN: 428348449 

08/19/2003 14:04 [D----] WAV 
01/01/2001 01:00 [-----] 82 CONFIG.INI 
Free Space is: 2160 clusters, 2211840 bytes 

The first line of information shows manufacturer information about the MMC card contained in the card identifier. 

The Manufacturer Identifier (MID) shows the numeric value of the manufacturer of the card. Known values are: 

1 – Infineon 
2 – Sandisk 
6 -Hitachi 

NOTE: If you have a card with an identifier not listed above, please let us know so that we can add it to our list. 

The Product Name (PNM) field displays the contents of the six character text field in the card identifier header. The text 
may include the products model number, or simply the vendor name. 

The Product Serial Number (PSN) field shows the 32 bit serial number of the card. 

The file attributes are shown inside brackets and include: 

· D – Directory 
· H – Hidden 
· R – Read Only 
· S – System 
· V -Volume 

Other than the directory attribute, the DAB ignores all other file attributes. 

The number of free clusters, which is the smallest disk allocation unit, and the number of free bytes remaining on the 
FLASH card are displayed at the bottom of the directory listing. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


DEL – Delete File 
While similar to the delete file command under MS-DOS, this command will only delete files in the present working 
directory, and will not accept wild cards. 
Example: 

7kDAB-WAV\4300>del 4380.wav 
File Deleted 

REN – Rename File 
While similar to the delete file command under MS-DOS, this command will only rename files in the present working 
directory, and will not accept wild cards. 
Example: 

7kDAB-\WAV\5000>ren 5024.wav 5035.wav 
File 5024.WAV renamed to 5035.WAV 

FIND – Find a file 
This command’s primary purpose is to show file access time performance information and will display the amount of time 
needed to find a given file within the file system. 
The user may find this command interesting to show the performance benefits of smaller vs. larger cluster sizes, and how 
the ordering of directory entries affects file access times. 
Example: 

7kDAB-\>find \wav\1000\1000.wav 
File Found. 22ms elapsed 

7kDAB-\>find \wav\4300\4390.wav 
File Found. 61ms elapsed 

7kDAB-\>find \wav\4300\4399.wav 
File not Found. 53ms elapsed

SY – Send Y-Modem 
Allows a file to be sent from the DAB to the users computer via the serial port. 
Most any popular terminal program written in the past 10-15 years will support Y-Modem file transfers. Since each 
program is different, please consult that software’s documentation for use of the file transfer capabilities of your terminal 
emulation program. 
The filename you wish to download into your computer should be specified on the command line, and needs to exist in the 
present working directory. 
Example: 

7kDAB-\>sy config.ini 
Start your YMODEM Download now. 

At which point you would start your file transfer software. 
RY – Receive Y-Modem 
Allows one or more files to be sent to the DAB from the users computer via the serial port. 

Example: 

7kDAB-WAV\4300>ryCCCCC 

The “C”’s shown in the example above are sent periodically by the DAB to signal to the host computer that the DAB 
wishes to start receiving files using the CRC checksum method. One startup character is sent every 3 seconds, and up to 
20 attempts are made before timing out. 

LO – Logout 
This command simply terminates a command line session, and will cause a modem to disconnect. 

REBOOT – Reboot DAB 

This command unceremoniously causes the DAB to reboot. It may be used to take advantage of new settings in the 
CONFIG.INI file. 

SMHOST – Force Smart Host Present Flag 

This command is needed after a Reboot command is issued in order to simulate a special handshake sequence that 
occurs when the 7K controller containing Version 2.04 software first powers up. Unless this handshake sequence is seen 
by the DAB, some of the more advanced features, such as being able to send commands to the 7K, will be locked out. 

Do not issue this command unless your 7K controller has Version 2.04 software. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


STOP – Stop current WAV file playback 

Immediately terminates the playback of any WAV file. This may be useful if the command line user wishes to interrupt the 
playback of a long WAV file in order to gain access to file management commands. 
TIME – Display or Set the current Time and Date 
This command will display or set a time of day clock in the 7KDAB. The time and date maintained within the 7KDAB will 

be used for the time and date stamp on any files written to the FLASH card. 
Note that when setting the time and date, only basic range checking is performed and that in some instances, the day of 
month will be set to the maximum number of days for that particular month. 

Note that the time of day maintained within the 7KDAB does not survive a power cycle, and that the clocks 
accuracy is not specified and may accumulate error of several minutes per day. 

Set time example: 

7kDAB-\>time 13:33:00 
7kDAB-\> 

Set time and date example: 

7kDAB-\>time 13:33:14 8/23/2007 
7kDAB-\> 

Display time and date example: 

7kDAB-\>time 
13:33:15 08/23/2007 

TYPE – Type a file to the console 
Causes the contents of a file to be echoed to the console serial port. 
Control-C can be used to abort the file echo. Control-S will pause the file echo, and Control-Q will resume. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


Command line interface commands available with 7K firmware 2.04 

#!; -Issuing commands to the 7K 
Perhaps one of the more appealing additions to the 7K firmware, when used in conjunction with the DAB, is that 
commands to the 7K can be entered on the serial port. 
Any digits preceded with an exclamation point will be sent to the 7K and treated as DTMF digits that appear to originate 
from within the controller. 
Input lines to the command processor are limited to 80 characters in length, but for long lines a continuation character “\” 
can be placed at the end of a line to signify more digits for a given command sequence will appear on a subsequent line. 
Command execution occurs when the Carriage Return character is received. 
White space characters may be freely inserted if it makes the line more readable. 
Multiple commands can be entered on one line by using the asterisk (“*”) to signify the end of one command and the start 
of the next. 
The octothorpe (“#”) can be used to cancel a command in progress. 
Any lines proceeded with an octothorpe (“#”) or a semicolon (“;”) are treated as comment lines and are simply ignored. 
This allows a commented script file to simply be uploaded with a terminal program to the DAB in order to program the 
controller. 
If the user desires to use a text file upload method to program the controller, the terminal program should be setup to pace 
itself either by waiting for a new command line prompt from the DAB to appear, or by adding a delay at the end of each 
line.

RFP – Remote Front Panel 

The remote front panel command allows real time viewing of the controller activity via the serial port. When this command 
is invoked a representation of the controller’s front panel, along with some additional data is displayed on your screen. 

A group of three reverse video spaces is used to form a block to denote an indicator that is ‘lit’ whereas a lower case ‘o’ is 
used to indicate an indicator which is ‘dark’. 

When speech playback is active, the current audio track being played will be shown in the upper right hand corner of the 
screen. 

The lower part of the screen is set aside to display decoded DTMF digits as they arrive, and to show where those digits 
are being received from. A new line is started each time a command is terminated with an asterisk (*) or octothorpe (#), 
or if the DTMF source changes. 

If for some reason the screen becomes garbled due to a missed character, you can type the letter “R” to refresh the 
screen. When the screen is repainted, the historical DTMF digit information of the screen is lost. 

The display mode can be exited at any time by hitting the escape key. 

Hit [ESC] to exit or 'R' to refresh Playing: 1027

Real time updates are not possible during DAB audio playback due to the fact that during playback, the interface between 
the 7K and DAB is dedicated to handshaking between these two units in a way that is compatible with the original S-COM 
speech synthesizer module. Information regarding controller operation can only be sent to the DAB during periods when 
the interface is otherwise available and I/O status change information will be sent to the DAB once speech playback has 
completed. 

The DAB firmware utilizes VT100 terminal commands to provide a fast and efficient means of updating the screen, and 
thus the user needs to utilize a suitable terminal or terminal emulation program to accomplish this. The list of software 
companies that provide terminal emulation and file transfer software is quite extensive and beyond our ability to provide a 
list of those that do work correctly vs. those that do not. However, limited testing of freeware, shareware, and commercial 
programs clearly demonstrate that “you get what you pay for” in terms of faithful emulation.

“Hyperterm” users will need to visit the Hilgraeve website http://www.hilgraeve.com/ and download a current version of 
this free terminal emulator in order for all characters to be properly displayed. For many years, Microsoft has bundled 
Hilgraeve’s terminal emulation software with Windows, and those bundled versions have some issues with some of the 
commands that the DAB uses. Hilgraeve’s website is silent as to when the bug(s) related to the screen redraw functions 
were addressed, but their version 6.3 appears to work fine. 

Hilgraeve’s product is the only “free” emulator known at this time to provide true VT100 emulation and YMODEM file 
transfer capabilities. If you find other programs that work, please let us know. 

SCRIPT – Execute text file to program the 7K controller 

Issuing the script command followed by a text file’s name will echo the contents of that file to the console, and any lines 
beginning with an exclamation point (‘!’) will be parsed and sent to the 7K controller in the same manner that a command 
may be directly executed from the command line. Just as with manually entered commands, long lines can be continued 
on the next line by ending the line with a back slash (‘\’). 

Lines beginning with an exclamation point are limited to 80 non-white space characters. Lines exceeding this length will 
prematurely terminate the file transfer to the 7K and display an error message. 

Keep in mind that the file will be transmitted as quickly as the 7K can receive it and if command responses are enabled 
could cause the 7K’s 400 byte message buffer to wrap resulting in some messages being lost or corrupted. 

Also keep in mind that the while this command is executing, no speech words can be played and will cause the 7K’s 
message system to stall and time out each individual word or phrase. Therefore, it is advised that any enabled command 
responses not utilize speech responses. 

Control-C can be used to abort the file execution. Control-S will pause execution, and Control-Q will resume.

Firmware Update Procedure. 

The product firmware can be updated by placing a new firmware image file in the root directory of the MMC card. This 
can be accomplished in one of two ways. 

MMC card reader/writer attached to your computer running Windows 

It is beyond the scope of this manual to provide a tutorial on the use of specific computer peripherals, as well as to make 

specific brand name recommendations for these third party devices. 
Your local computer store, or your favorite on-line retailer, should have these products readily available, although you may 
find the term “Secure Digital” more widely used than “MultiMedia Card” or “MMC”. The two technologies are similar, with 
Secure Digital being an extension of the MultiMedia Card standard. Secure Digital cards are slightly thicker, and cannot 
be used in 7KDAB boards prior to board revision “F”, but a Secure Digital card reader should accept a MMC card. 

1.) Download the new firmware binary file to a temporary storage location on your computer. 
2.) Remove the MMC card from the DAB and place it in your FLASH card drive. 
2.) Copy the firmware binary file into the root directory on the card. 
3.) After the file copy has completed, wait at least 30 seconds before removing the card from the drive to allow the system 

to flush any unwritten data to the disk. 
4.) Re-insert the card into the DAB 
5.) When the card is re-inserted and power is applied, you will see the message "Updating FLASH program", followed by 

a reset message indicating a software reboot. You should note that the power on message indicates that the new version 
of firmware is running. 
6.) Once the firmware update is complete, you may delete the firmware binary file from the MMC card. 

Use your terminal emulator to transfer a file to the MMC card 

1.) Download the new firmware binary file to a temporary storage location on your computer. 
2.) Using a terminal emulator, issue the "RY" command at the "7kDAB> prompt. 
3.) Within your terminal emulator, initiate a Y-MODEM file transfer of the new binary firmware file. You only have 30 

seconds to start the file transfer or the DAB will timeout and cancel the file transfer. 
4.) When the file transfer is complete, issue the "reboot" command at the command prompt. 
5.) When the DAB reboots, you will see the message "Updating FLASH program", followed by a reset message indicating 

a software reboot. You should note that the power on message indicates that the new version of firmware is running. 
6.) Once the firmware update is complete, you may delete the firmware binary file from the MMC card.

Appendix E 7K Version 2.04 Release Notes 

Disclaimer 

While this software is derived from SCOM’s Version 2.03b firmware, it is not supported by SCOM. Any support issues 
related to this software need to be directed to Vyex LLC. 

The copyright for this software is still held by SCOM and it is SCOM’s sole discretion that determines how this firmware 
may be made available. 

Overview 

This firmware version contains new functionality to better integrate the 7K Digital Audio Board (DAB) with the operation of 
the repeater controller. 

In addition to DAB specific additions, additional controller enhancements were introduced and are presented in this 
appendix. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


New Commands 

{PW} 16 Stop playback of current speech word 

Issuing this command will kill a spoken word currently in progress. It’s intent is to provide a means of halting a long 
informational message. 

{PW} 24 xxxx Remove Command From Macro 

Removes last command from Macro ‘xxxx’. 

Reports “OK” if successful, or “? LAST” if there is only one command left in the macro. 

To delete the last command in the macro, you need to delete the macro and re-create it. 

{PW} 36 T F xxxx Modify ID Timers 

T = ‘1’ for Transmitter 1, or ‘2’ for Transmitter 2 

F = function code 
0 Terminate ID timer activity. If ID is pending, it is cancelled. 
1 Set ID timer to maximum. ID is NOT triggered. 
2 Set ID timer to maximum. ID is immediately triggered. 
3 Ensure Normal ID cycle. Start’s ID timer if not already running, otherwise this command has no 

effect. 
4 Ensure Final ID cycle. Start’s ID timer if not already running, and sets the pending ID flag as 
though user activity had occurred. If timer was running, this command has no effect. 
5 If ID timer is not running, set the ID timer to maximum and execute macro ‘xxxx’ 

xxxx = Macro name for function 5 

Example use showing a friendly on the hour ID: 

{PW} 28 01 8001 99 99 06 59 ;enable on the hour ID’s starting at 6:59am 
{PW} 28 02 8002 99 99 21 01 ;disable on the hour ID’s ending at 9:01pm 

{PW} 20 8001 {PW} 28 00 4000 99 99 99 00 ;create hourly scheduler setpoint 
{PW} 20 8002 {PW} 28 00 ;delete hourly scheduler setpoint 

{PW} 20 4000 {PW} 36 5 4001 ;if ID timer is not running, call macro 4001 
;and start the ID timer running 

; Macro 4001 speaks “KA9FUR repeater” and if interrupted by user activity will revert to “KA9FUR” in CW 

{PW} 20 4001 {PW} 15 9981 9961 000 0260 0001 0335 0149 0540 0401 0421 9902 54 59 0852 67 20 10 09 15 30 27 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


{PW} 49 90/91/92/93 xx Message Handler Initial Message Delay 

Timer’s 90 through 93 now allow the user to determine the initial message delay value for individual message types. 

In previous versions, these timer delay values were fixed at 1.0 seconds. The user can now specify a timer value of zero 
to 5.0 seconds with 100ms resolution. 

Timer: 

90 – CW pre-message delay associated with special message character ‘54’ 
91 – Beep pre-message delay associated with special message character ‘54’ 
92 – Paging pre-message delay that is always present 
93 – Speech pre-message delay associated with special word ‘0000’ 

These timer delay’s are utilized only at the beginning of a new message sequence, and with the exception of a paging 
sequence, the delay only occurs if the message begins with the special message character or word. 

Examples: 

{PW} 49 90 15 ;set CW initial delay to 1.5 seconds 
{PW} 49 93 20 ;set speech initial delay to 2.0 seconds 

;send CW message “KA9FUR” with an initial delay 
{PW} 15 9900 54 59 0852 67 20 10 09 15 30 27 

;send speech message “KA9FUR repeater” with an initial delay 
{PW} 15 9960 0000 0260 0001 0335 0149 0540 0401 0421 

{PW} 49 94/95 xx Logic output pulse duration 

These timers were introduced in version 2.04f. 

Timer 94 now sets the logic pulse ON duration, and timer 95 sets the logic pulse OFF duration. Timer units are in 10ms 
increments with the minimum value of 10ms and the maximum of 2540ms. 

The pulsed output duration may vary up to +/-10ms. 

NOTE: If new firmware is installed in a controller that previously contained an older 2.04 variant AND the 
controller is not cold initialized, the timer values will default to zero, meaning the pulsed outputs will not work. In 
order to retain backward compatibility either manually set both of the timer values to ‘50’ (500ms), OR cold 
initialize the controller. 

Examples: 

{PW} 49 94 50 ;set logic output pulsed on delay to 500ms 
{PW} 49 95 10 ;set logic output pulsed off delay to 100ms

New Switches 

{PW} 63 16 x Daylight Savings time correction 
This switch defaults to ‘off’. 
If switch is turned on, one hour will be added to the Real Time Clock at 2:00am on the first Sunday in April, and one hour 
will be subtracted at 2:00am on the last Sunday in October. 

{PW} 63 19 x Ignore Landline Busy Input 
This switch defaults to ‘off’. 
If switch is turned on, the landline busy input will be ignored by the interconnect routines and becomes available for the 
user to utilize as a generic user input with the commands that are otherwise already available. 

{PW} 63 33 x Enable “OK” Command Responses 
{PW} 63 34 x Enable “?ERR” Command Responses 
These two switches default to ‘on’. 
Note: Switch 02 still acts as a master enable/disable function for command responses. 

{PW} 63 35 x Courtesy message can be queued during message playback 
This switch defaults to ‘off’. 
Turning this switch on will, for example, allow a courtesy message to play after the initial ID. 

{PW} 63 36 x Suppress command responses within macro execution 
This switch defaults to ‘off’. 
Turning this switch on will, inhibit simple (i.e. “OK”, and “ERR?”) command responses when commands are executed from 
within a macro. 

This switch command was introduced in 2.04e.

Changed Commands 

{PW} 02 f … CTCSS Encoder 

Function code ‘f’ Description 
0 CTCSS Encoder OFF 
1 CTCSS Encoder ON continuously when transmitter is active 
2 Tx1 coupled OFF delay. 
Turns on when Transmitter goes active, and turns off when 
delay timer expires. 
3 Receiver for Tx1 coupled OFF delay. 
Turns on when any receiver with a path to Tx1 goes active, 
and turns off when delay timer expires. 
4 Receiver for Tx1 coupled loss OFF delay. 
Turns on when any receiver with a path to Tx1 is active, and 
upon signal loss starts delay timer. When delay timer expires, 
encoder is turned off. 
7 Zero’s the dynamic timer value, forcing the encoder to 
immediately turn off. 
8 ‘xxx’ Set’s the default timer value to ‘xx.x” seconds. Valid range is 
0 to 12.7 seconds. 
9 ‘x’ Associates user output ‘x’ with the CTCSS encode function. 0 
disables feature, 1-6 associate a User output with this feature. 

Examples: 

Encode during user transmissions and hold the encoder active for an additional 200ms after receiver squelch closes 
to allow for mobile flutter. Use this example for making your repeater more compatible with an on air linking method, 
such as IRLP, that relies on the CTCSS encoder following user activity. 

{PW} 02 8 2 ;set timer value to 200ms 
{PW} 02 9 3 ;(optional) associate user output 3 with CTCSS encode function 
{PW} 02 4 ;set mode 4 to cause CTCSS to be encoded during all user transmissions 

Function ‘7’ could be used to disable the CTCSS encoder after a courtesy message is sent. 

{PW} 02 8 127 ;set timer to maximum value 
{PW} 02 4 ;select mode 4 
{PW} 20 1234 {PW} 02 7 ;create macro 1234 with cmd 02 function 7 
{PW} 31 10 9910 74 09 9999 1234 ;60ms, 440Hz beep followed by macro 1234

{PW} 40 r xxx Set Transmit Timeout Timers 

The new ‘r’, receiver, parameter allows the user to independently set different transmit timeout timer values based on the 
active receiver(s). Valid values are 1, 2, or 3. 

The valid range for ‘xxx’ remains the same. A value of ‘0’ (zero) disables the timeout timer for a given receiver. 

The timeout logic was changed such that each receiver now has its own timeout timer. Once ANY timer is started, it is not 
reset until the courtesy message event occurs. 

Command 10 will reset ALL timeout timers simultaneously. 

{PW} 89 … Select DTMF Priority/Scan 

This command was changed to cause the DTMF decoder immediately re-prioritize the DTMF inputs rather than waiting for 
a high priority device to release it. 

{PW} 50 0/1 99 Review Initial and Normal Tail ID’s 

This command now only sends the tail ID message rather than causing the full ID to be sent. The change was necessary 
due to some code restructuring related to how these messages are stored internally. 

{PW} 96 t xx Set DTMF Mute Delay 

The DTMF muting logic has been changed to utilize two separate mute delay timers. One timer applies only to the first 
DTMF digit, the other timer applies to all subsequent digits. Setting the mute time for the first digit relatively short or to 
zero, and the mute timer for all subsequent digits substantially longer will provide better performance in situations where 
decoder falsing has been a problem. 

When a “*” or “#” command terminator is received, the 1st digit delay timer value will be loaded into the mute timer, thus 
un-muting the audio more quickly upon command completion. 

A ‘t’ (timer) value of zero (0) allows the first digit delay timer to be set, and a value of one (1) allows the delay timer for all 
subsequent digits to be set. 

The timer value ‘xx’ is set in 100ms units and can range from zero to 2.5 seconds. 

On a cold reset, both timers default to 500ms. 

Example: 

{PW} 96 0 3 ;set 1st digit delay timer to 300ms 
{PW} 96 1 25 ;set subsequent digit delay timer to 2.5 seconds 

{PW} 63 xx 0/1/2/3 Set User Switch 

In version 2.04e, if the switch values of ‘2’ or ‘3’ are used, they will turn the corresponding switch ‘off’ or ‘on’ but will not 
send any command response. This addition was made for those who wish to eliminate command responses from within 
macros, but who do not wish to use the new functionality in user switch 36 to suppress all command responses from 
within a macro.

New Message Types 

Four new message types were added to support interruptible speech and Morse messages. 

9901 -CW Primary 
9902 -CW Secondary 
9911 -Beep Primary 
9912 -Beep Secondary 
9961 -Speech Primary 
9962 -Speech Secondary 

Primary messages will cease playback if a receiver with its path enabled to a transmitter associated with the message 
playback is active at the time the playback commences, or any time during message playback. 

Secondary messages will only play in circumstances when a primary message would not. 

Examples: 

This message would speak “KA9FUR Repeater” but if a receiver went active would revert to “KA9FUR” in CW. 

{PW} 15 9981 9961 0260 0001 0335 0149 0540 0401 0421 9902 59 0852 67 20 10 09 15 30 27 

The following set’s the courtesy tone as mixed on Tx1 as a secondary beep message such that any activity on the 
repeater will cause the courtesy message to be discarded. When the new switch “35” is enabled, courtesy messages will 
be queued when the repeater is initially activated and an ID is sent. If the resulting courtesy message is not sent as a 
“primary” message, then the courtesy message would be sent immediately after the initial ID even if there was user 
activity present. 

{PW} 31 10 9981 9911 76 55 57 0459 12 57 0512 04 ;set courtesy message 

Operational Changes 

Added area codes 877 and 866 to the toll free table. 
Command 30 and 80 will now accept 1 or 2 digit timer values. 
Command 32, transmitter drop out delay, will now accept 1, 2, or 3 digit timer values of up to 12.7 seconds. 
Commands 40, 65, and 79 will now accept a single zero rather than requiring 3 zeros. 
A new courtesy message will not be placed in the global message queue if there is still a courtesy message pending in 

the queue. Note that this change only applies to the courtesy message ({PW} 31 10…) and that the courtesy event macro 

will still be triggered without regard as to whether the courtesy message has been sent or not. 
The speech board timeout timer is now 10 seconds rather than the 25 seconds in previous versions (even though it was 
documented as being 5 seconds it was really 25 seconds). 

The number of permissible macros has been increased to 340. 
Fixed CW messages were modified to include the special initial delay character ‘54’ at the beginning of the message such 
that an initial delay is present.

Bug Fixes and Changes 
Version 2.04 

Special Messages 9860 through 9895 will no longer cause the controller to crash. 
Fixed a problem that could cause the hardware watchdog to trip during cold initialization. 

Note: When upgrading from one version 2.04 variant to another, there is no need to cold initialize the controller. 
Version 2.04a 

This version fixes the macro corruption problem in commands 00, 02, 40, 50, 76, and 96. 

A potential problem related to the courtesy beep was addressed. There was a potential that could require the controller to 
be cold initialized in order for the controller to once again generate a courtesy beep message. 

An initial delay character, 54, was added to command 33’s message playback to allow more time for the control user to 
hear the entire command response. 

Version 2.04b 

This version fixes a problem with command 76. Some of the IF tests were incorrectly testing some byte wide variables as 
words and vice versa. Due to the nature of the bug, there is no way to tell, at any given movement, which tests would be 
made incorrectly. 

Command 76 was also changed to queue any resulting macro at the head of the work queue rather than at the end of the 
queue. This allows the immediate execution of the macro, which in turn also allows the nesting and stacking of IF tests. 

Command 65 was broken in the transition from 2.03b to 2.04 and was not setting the timer to the user supplied value. 
The command now works correctly. 

Version 2.04c 

This version fixes additional problems with command 76. The tests of hardware inputs did not work correctly and always 
returned TRUE. 

As a result of the changes in 2.04c, when this version is run for the first time, all appropriate input transition events will 
execute once on power up. This is due to the way that the last known input state is stored in non-volatile memory. 

Version 2.04d 

This version fixes an old bug in the Remote Base software that was exposed as a result of unrelated changes made in 

2.04 to the way that the interrupt time slicing works. Specifically when entering a command such as RBPW 41 147000 2 
the controller would incorrectly return ?ERR 2 rather than allowing the command to execute. 
Version 2.04e 

This version added additional functionality to command 63 to suppress command responses from within macros, as well 
as new user switch 36, which modifies the behavior of command responses as a result of command execution from within 
a macro. 

7KDAB, Version 2.0, 19-Aug-2007 Ó Vyex LLC, 2003-2007 


Version 2.04f 

· Fixed a problem introduced in version 2.04a related to being able to queue multiple courtesy beep messages while a 
message playback was already in progress. 

· Added separate time-out timer reset delay timers to prevent a situation where a short transmission on one receiver 
could prematurely cause a time-out of a receiver with a longer time-out time set. An example of this would be if the 
time-out timer for Rx1 was set to 30 minutes, and Rx2 was set to 3 minutes, if a long transmission was in progress on 
Rx1 and a brief transmission occurred on Rx2, the repeater would time out based on the shorter 3 minute time even 
though Rx2 had gone inactive. The new method will allow the individual time-out timers to be reset after the courtesy 
delay period has elapsed even though a courtesy message was not necessarily generated… in other words, the 
courtesy reset time is still imposed on individual receivers even though a different receiver still remains active. 

· Added programmable logic output pulse on/off duration periods. 

· Added new feature such that if the internal INIT button is held for 5 seconds AFTER power up has occurred, the 
Master Password will be reset to default (99) and the Warm Reset message will be sent as an acknowledgement. 
Useful for regaining control if the password(s) are lost, forgotten or mistakenly changed. 

· The software version runtime variables for CW (9898) and Speech (9899) now include the version suffix as part of the 
message.

When installing the daughter board, take care to properly align the female header connector with the Speech connector 
on the 7K main printed circuit board. Extreme damage can occur if any of the ribbon connectors are misaligned or 
if the daughter board is plugged in 180 degree’s from its proper orientation.
